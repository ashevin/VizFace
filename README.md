# Emotion

The Emotion app analyzes a selected photo to determine the emotion displayed.  Only photos of faces are supported.  Photos may be taken by the camera, or selected from the camera roll.

### Build Requirements

- Xcode 11.0

### Environment

The app has been tested on iOS 13, running on the simulator, and iOS 12 on the device.
The app does not run on a device with iOS 13 because it is not possible to establish a secure TSL connection with the domain generated by Azure.

### Purpose

The app demonstrates basic design principles involving asynchronous network requests and the handling of errors.
